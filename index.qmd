## Bio

My name is Rene Welch and I am a mixture between biostatician and computational biologist, working at the intersection of ML, immunology and cancer. 

In a previous life, I used to work on computational finance topics when I graduated with a BSc in Applied Mathematics from ITAM in Mexico, and then I changed gears towards the study of epigenomics and GWAS when I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.

Currently, I am part of the [Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://biostat.wisc.edu) where I work as a scientist in [Dr. Irene Ong lab](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ong/) and at the [Cancer and Informatics Shared Resource](https://cancer.wisc.edu/research/resources/cisr/)

## Personal life

I live in Madison, where I spend my free time biking :bike: around the city.
