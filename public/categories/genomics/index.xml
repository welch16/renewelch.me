      <description> ChIPUtils is an R package that contains many functions used for exploratory analysis of ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo data. It includes some commonly used quality control measures:
PCR bottleneck coefficient Strand cross-correlation </description>

      <description>ChIPexoQual is a quality control pipeline for ChIP-exo/nexus data. ChIP-exo/nexus experiments rely on innovative modifications of the commonly used ChIP-seq protocol for high resolution mapping of transcription factor binding sites. Although many aspects of the ChIP-exo data analysis are similar to those of ChIP-seq, these high throughput experiments pose a number of unique quality control and analysis challenges. We develop a novel statistical quality control pipeline and accompanying R/Bioconductor package, ChIPexoQual, to enable exploration and analysis of ChIP-exo and related experiments.</description>

      <description>Segvis is a package to visualize genomic data around genomic regions. An R package to visualize ChIP-seq experiments across a set of pre-defined peaks. The package requires a set of pre-defined genomic regions, and aligned reads in bam format. We can do many tasks with it, some examples are:
Extracts read data of specified input regions Plot peaks of different conditions across the same set of regions Plot central measures for a set of regions with the same width Subset regions according to used defined annotations Plot the heatmap of signal curves accross regions separated by annotation The package is available here</description>
